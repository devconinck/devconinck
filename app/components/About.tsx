          Hello! I'm Quinten, a passionate software developer with a knack for
          creating efficient and scalable web applications. With a strong
          background in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy
          solving complex problems and continuously learning new skills. I'm
          currently studying Web Development at HOGENT and am excited to take on
          new challenges in the tech industry.

          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors,
          playing video games, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
          Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on a
          project!
